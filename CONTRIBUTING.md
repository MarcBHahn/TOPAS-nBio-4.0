We highly welcome user contributions! 
If you wish to contribute your own extensions to the TOPAS-nBio project to share your effort with other researchers, please follow these steps:
* Clean up your code, remove G4cout statements, debugging messages, unused variables, commented out sections of the code etc.
* Use variable names that are explanatory. A variable called "a" does not typically help with the readability of the code. We prefer long varibale names that make the code understandable without having to follow each logic thread.
* Use the parameter manager to allow definition of all variables through the parameter system, hard coded numbers are most times not necessary.
* Avoid warning messages when compiling.

Once your code is ready, please submit it to the developer team, we will test it and then add it to the repository. 

We suggest that you first publish your results before sharing your code. You can further add your own name in the top section of the contributed classes.
